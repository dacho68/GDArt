# GDArt
There are 2 parts in this applicaiton.
- Front End .\WebApplication\ClientApp
- Back End .\WebApplication\Controllers

## Front End Development

This ClientApp project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.0.dir

- I recommend using Studio Code for editing ClientApp.
```
GDArt\WebApplication\ClientApp\code .
```

- Install Angular/CLI globaly
```
>npm install -g @angular/cli@latest
```
- Install other packages
```
>npm install
```

- Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
```
>ng serve
```

You could debug with Angular directly in code. Select Debug>Start Debuging. You must run code in GDArt\WebApplication\ClientApp

## Running from VS 2017 (15.9.4)
you could run directly from VS 2107 

## Deloy in Azure

Current I'm using VS2017 (GDArt.sln) and manually publish 

https://gdart.azurewebsites.net/#


## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).



## Using Studio Code

Go to the ClientApp folder, at this level, you can code Angular as the normal way
